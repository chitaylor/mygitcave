<p style="color:black">Powderfinger, an Australian rock band, formed in Brisbane in 1989. From 1992 to 2010 the lineup consisted of vocalist Bernard Fanning, guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug, bass guitarist John Collins and drummer Jon Coghill. The group's third studio album, Internationalist, peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in September 1998. Their next studio album, Odyssey Number Five, reached number one in September 2000 and was certified eight times platinum, shipping over 560,000 units. Their next three studio albums also reached number one: Vulture Street (July 2003), Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (June 2007) and Golden Rule (November 2009). Powderfinger earned the third-highest total of ARIA Awards (18), after Silverchair and John Farnham. Their last tour, the Sunsets Farewell Tour, concluded on 13 November 2010. In November the following year, the band published a biography with Dino Scatena, a rock music journalist, called Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band. After the release of their first DVD, These Days: Live in Concert (September 2004), and the compilation album Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994â€“2000 (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005. The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide Tour, followed the release of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. Powderfinger were involved in philanthropic causes. In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney, to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families. One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia, and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. In April 2010 Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour, declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically said everything they wanted to say. On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment. In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and the band published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band.</p>
