		<h1>Sample Responsive 2 Column</h1>

			<p>Today, a website must not look good only on a desktop screen, but also on tablets and smartphones. A website is responsive if it is able to adapt to the screen of the client. In this article, I’ll show you how to easily make a website responsive in three easy steps.</p>
			<p>When building a responsive website, or making responsive an existing site, the first element to look at is the layout. When I build responsive websites, I always start by creating a non-responsive layout, fixed at the default size. For example, CatsWhoCode.com default width is 1100px. When I’m pleased with the non-responsive version, I add media queries and slight changes to my code to make the code responsive. It’s way easier to focus on one task at a time.</p>
			<p>When you’re done with your non-responsive website, the first thing to do is to paste the following lines within the <head> and </head> tags on your html page. This will set the view on all screens at a 1×1 aspect ratio and remove the default functionality from iPhones and other smartphone browsers which render websites at full-view and allow users to zoom into the layout by pinching.</p>
